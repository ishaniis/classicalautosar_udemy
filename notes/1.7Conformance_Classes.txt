Three conformance Classes: 

1.ICC1: 
1.1 Lowest Implementation

1.2 RTE and BSW is put into one cluster.

1.3 Which all elements need to AUTOSAR Conformance:
1.3.1 RTE
1.3.2 ASW (Application Software)
1.3.3 Interface to the BUS

1.4 BSW is regarded as the blackbox , allowing legacy platform to be migrated to AUTOSAR, to support SwC's. 

2. ICC2:
2.1 Logically related modules
2.2 Bundled into separate cluster as per the logic.
2.3 For Example: All comm related modules form one cluster

3. ICC3
3.1 ICC3 is the highest conformance to the AUTOSAR architecture. 
3.2 All BSW modules as defined by AUTOSAR(Ideally) - The ideal Implementation of the AUTOSAR
3.3 No more clustering being done at this stage of the conformance. 
3.4 Follows all the AUTOSAR standards and modules.
