Introduction to Diagnositcs:
System of detecting, reposting and handling of faults in the System

Standardized mechanism to communicate diag information between ECU's. 


1. DEM (Diagnositcs Event Management): Responsible to detect and report faults in a system
2. DCM (Diagnositcs communication Management): Responsible to communicate diagnostic information in between (inter) ECU's and diagnostics tools
- Provides services for handling diagnostic requests and responses
- Stores and retrieves Diagnositcs information.
- Interacts with AUTOSAR Standardized interfaces.

DEM
- Responsible for processing and storing diagnostic events and associated data
- Provides fault information to DCM
- Offers interfaces to Application layer & BSW modules
- Stores into memory:
- - faults
- - Fault related data

Diagnostic Monitors:
- Monitors the functionality as a routine entity of component
- Identifies specific fault type in the path which is being monitored (Often called as Monitoring path)
