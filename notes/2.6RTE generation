There are basically two stages:

A.RTE Contract Stage
B. RTE Generation Stage


A. RTE Contract 
- Limited information about the component is available to us. 
- AUTOSAR interface definition are used to create:
- - Application header of the component types
What is application header ?
Defines the Contract between RTE and the component. 

What all things are defined in a contract?
- Ports
- Component types
- Interface is defined
- Connection between ports is defined

From this contract information -> Component API (Application Header (.h) file) is generated

What is means to deliver component at RTE contract stage?
- (.xml) Component type is defined
- (.xml) Component's behavior is defined (Internally) and described
- Actual Source or Object Code of the component
- Component Implementation is described

B. RTE Generation Stage
At RTE generation stage, can be further splitted into two types:
- RTE Configuration editing
- - When Configuration Editor has all required information from ECU Configuration description & there exists an internal structure
- - Now, with the internal structure present, it can start to place requirements of other modules - COM & OS.
- - Editor works incrementally until config issues are resolved. 

- RTE Generation Phase
- - After ECU has been configured, actual RTE generation can be performed
- - After config issues, are resolved, RTE can be generated in parallel for all the modules together. 

Phase workflow: 
Collection of available SwC Implementations (.xml) -> Configure System -> System Configuration description (.xml) -> Extract ECU specific description -> ECU Extract of System COnfiguration -> Configure ECU -> ECU Configuration Description (.xml) -> Generation of RTE (.c(RTE Code) and .h(RTE Header))

Summary:

RTE Contract Phase:
Inputs:
- SwC description
Outputs:
- Application Header (.h)
- Files and Application
- Header type

RTE Generation Phase:
Inputs:
- SwC Description
- System Configuration Description
- ECU Configuration Description
Outputs:
- Application type
- Header File
- Callback
- Hook Header File
- RTE Source File
