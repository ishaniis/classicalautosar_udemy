Types of Autosar interfaces:

1. Autosar Interface:
1.1 Defines information exchange between software components and BSW Modules. 
1.2 Used to define the ports of SwC and BSW modules
1.3 For Example: Rte_Read_xx() , Rte_Write_xx()

2. Standardized Interface
2.1 Interfaces are pre-defined by Autosar standard as an API (in C Language)
2.2 Used between BSW modules in ECU:
2.2.1 RTE & OS
2.2.2 RTE & BSW module
2.3 All the C Functions which are used to interact with the BSW module will remain the same. 
2.4 Implementations might be different but the function names will be same, even if the stack comes from Elektrobit or Vector. 

3. Standardized Autosar Interface
3.1 It is a SPECIAL Autosar interface predefined by Autosar
3.2 Types of interfaces used by SwC to access Autosar Services
3.3 Provided by BSW Modules of Service Layer
3.4 Example: ECU State Manager or Diagnostic Event Manager
