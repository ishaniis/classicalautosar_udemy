Autosar can be broadly divided into:

1. BSW (Basic Software) 
1.1 BSW can be further divided into following:
1.1.1 Input/Output
1.1.2 memory
1.1.3 Crypto
1.1.4 Communication
1.1.5 Off-Board Communication
1.1.6 System

2. ASW (Application Software)
3. RTE (Run-time Enviornment): Intermediate interface letting application to utilize BSW Layer. 

From Top to Bottom:
1. Application Software
2. RTE
3. Basic Software
4. Hardware


Now, In terms of the layers within the BSW:

Top to Bottom
- Application Layer
- RTE (RTE_Read or RTE_write)
- Services Layer
- ECU Abstraction Layer
- - Offers an API to access peripherals and devices 
- MCAL (Microcontroller Abstraction Layer)
- - Contains Driver(Internal)
- Hardware

CDD (Complex Device Driver) layer sits in between Hardware and RTE, allowing ASW to communicate for time-sensitive tasks
Eg. Airbag deployment and actuation for the airbag in terms of emergency.
