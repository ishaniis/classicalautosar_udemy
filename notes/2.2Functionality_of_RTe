1. functionalities of RTE

1.1 RTE is responsible to link AUTOSAR SwC
1.2 SwC communicate via this link provided by RTE
1.3 RTE acts as means by which AUTOSAR SwC access BSW modules including the OS and Communication services
1.4 RTE implements the VFB (Virtual function Bus) for each ECU (Concept of Virtual Functions - Cpp development)
1.5 RTE abstracts the SwC layer from Implementation of BSW and from How
1.6 RTE enables SwC to be reused in different ECU's. 

1.7 RTE allows us to use: OS & its modules, memory services and Communication services. 
 
1.8 RTE is divided into two parts:
1.8.1 Communication between SwC's
1.8.2 Scheduling of SwC's. 

1.9 RTE has interfaces using which runnables in SwC communicates with other SwC or BSW module
1.10 RTE maps runnables to OS tasks as configured during RTE configuration. 
1.11 RTE is responsible to execute runnables & triggering them as & when needed. 

1.12 RTE is strongly linked with BSW scheduler due to some OS tasks. OS tasks can be used for:
1.12.1 Scheduling of SwC's 
1.12.2 Scheduling entities of BSW module.
