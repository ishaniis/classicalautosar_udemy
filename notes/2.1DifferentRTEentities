Different RTE entities:

1. Software component:
1.1 ASW (Application SwC): 
1.2 SensorActuator SwC:
1.3 Parameter SwC: Handles calibration parameters, used to share calibration parameters. Don't have internal behavior
1.4 Composition SwC: 
1.5 Service Proxy SwC: Acts as a proxy to provide internal services to one/more remote ECU's. 
1.6 Swervice SwC: Services specified BSW
1.7 ECU Abs SwC: I/O by directly interacting with BSW modules. Other SwC cannot be used for accessing I/O.
1.8 Complex Device Driver (CDD) SwC: Used to develop CDD for external devices, which AUTOSAR don't support or have any time critical requirements.
1.9 NvBlock SwC: SwC is used to interact with NVRAM or memory. 

2. Composition:
2.1 Used to build heirarchial system. 
2.2 A group of SwC to a single ECU during system configuration. 
2.3 Grouping is logical & it helps to standardize the process

3. Port
3.1 Two types of Ports:
3.1.1 Provider
3.1.2 Receiver

3.2 Ports are medium of communication for SwC, to communicate between external medium
3.3 Application: Data transfer and received etc. 
3.4 Data which will be transfered is known, as it helps to standardize the entire process. 
3.5 Port belongs to one SwC at a given instant.

4. Port Interface

5. Connector
5.1 Different types of Connectors:
5.1.1 Assembly: When Communication happens inside a given Composition.
5.1.2.1 Delegation: When some ports of SwC need to be exposed outside the Composition. 
5.1.2.2 Reason for Delegation: As Autosar doesn't allows communication to happen outside composition directly, so using delegation the communication can happen in two different compositions. 


6. Internal Behavior
6.1 Consists of 
6.1.1 Runnable entity
6.1.1.1 Where Application logic is written
6.1.1.2 Analogous to function in C programming, in which we create runable in a SwC during configuration.
6.1.1.3 Function skeleton is generated in respective source files of SwC's.
6.1.1.4 Name of the skeleton function is the same that we give to the runnable at the time of configuration 
6.1.1.5 Runnables have: 
6.1.1.5.1 Variables
6.1.1.5.2 Trigger/Calls: Activated when a certain condition is met. These conditions are also defined during the configuration.
All the things required (runnable entities - Functions - where we write our logic) - We write our logic inside the generated skeleton from configuration softwares.

6.1.2 Three types of Runnables:
6.1.2.1 Init : init of ECU
6.1.2.2 Periodic: Execute operations periodically
6.1.2.3 Server: Used to implement server of Client/Server port interface

6.2 RTE events
6.2.1 Different types of RTE events
6.2.1.1 Timing events
6.2.1.2 Data received events
6.2.1.3 Operation invoked 
6.2.1.4 Mode Switch 
6.2.1.5 Data Received Error
6.2.1.6 Data Send Completed 

6.3 Exclusive Areas
